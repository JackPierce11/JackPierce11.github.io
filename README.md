# **Jack Pierce Portfolio**

## **About me**

I am a graduate with a Masters in Physics with Philosophy from the University of Manchester that has a passion for the world of data.

## **Projects**

[1. Predicting the Winner For Premier League Matches](https://github.com/JackPierce11/Premier-League-Project)

### Predicting Premier League Winner Conclusion
We found that the **random forest classifier** performed the best on our data, with a **CV score of 0.692** and a **test accuracy score of 0.728**. This means that this model can correctly predict the winner of a football match by seeing the post match stats roughly 73% of the time. 

Below is a table that summarises the results for all the models:

Below is a confusion matrix for the random forest classifier:

[2. Predicting House Price Sale Value](https://github.com/JackPierce11/Predicting-House-Prices)

### Predicting House Prices Conclusion

We can see that our blended predictions had an **r2 score of 0.969781 on the train set** and a **root mean squared error of 13,810 dollars on the original scale.** Our best performing individual model was the Lasso model with an **r2 score of 0.914418** and a **root mean squared error of 18,919 dollars on the original scale**. We will use the blended model to make predictions on the test set and submit those predictions to the kaggle competition.

Below we can see a summary of the performance of all the models:

Looking the feature importance for the Lasso and Ridge models we can conclude that the characteristics most important to the house price are related to **the size of the house, the size of the land and the quality of the house**.

In the kaggle competition my submission got a score of **0.13205**. This placed me in position 925 out of 3869 teams **(top 24%)**

plan of action:
- Go through these projects to make the portfolio presentable (research needed)
  - having a clear, factual numerical conclusions (want to show I am results focused)
  - Following conventions for projects in general
- Have these projects from the github presented well on the github pages portfolio
- Bulk out the github pages portfolio
  - about me sections
  - education section
- Use a theme that makes the portfolio clean and visually pleasing
